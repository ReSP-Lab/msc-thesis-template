    abstract = {The companion book to COURSERA{\textregistered}'s wildly popular massive open online course "Learning How to Learn" Whether you are a student struggling to fulfill a math or science requirement, or you are embarking on a career change that requires a new skill set, A Mind for Numbers offers the tools you need to get a better grasp of that intimidating material. Engineering professor Barbara Oakley knows firsthand how it feels to struggle with math. She flunked her way through high school math and science courses, before enlisting in the army immediately after graduation. When she saw how her lack of mathematical and technical savvy severely limited her options—both to rise in the military and to explore other careers—she returned to school with a newfound determination to re-tool her brain to master the very subjects that had given her so much trouble throughout her entire life. In A Mind for Numbers, Dr. Oakley lets us in on the secrets to learning effectively—secrets that even dedicated and successful students wish they'd known earlier. Contrary to popular belief, math requires creative, as well as analytical, thinking. Most people think that there's only one way to do a problem, when in actuality, there are often a number of different solutions—you just need the creativity to see them. For example, there are more than three hundred different known proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem. In short, studying a problem in a laser-focused way until you reach a solution is not an effective way to learn. Rather, it involves taking the time to step away from a problem and allow the more relaxed and creative part of the brain to take over. The learning strategies in this book apply not only to math and science, but to any subject in which we struggle. We all have what it takes to excel in areas that don't seem to come naturally to us at first, and learning them does not have to be as painful as we might think!},

    abstract = {In this paper we present how multi-party designated verifier signatures can be used as generic solution to the coercion-freeness problem in electronic voting schemes. We illustrate the concept of multi-party designated verifier signatures with an enhanced version of Ghodosi and Pieprzyk [GP06]'s threshold signature scheme. The proposed scheme is efficient, secure, allows distributed computations of the sig- nature on the ballot receipt and can be parameterized to set a threshold on the number of required signers. The security of the designated verifier property is evaluated using the simulation paradigm [Gol00] based on the security analysis of [GHKR08]. Unlike previously provable schemes ours is ideal, i.e. the bit-lenght of each secret key share is bounded by the bit-lenght of the RSA modulus.},

    abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the notion of mental voting booths, i.e., a building block for voting schemes that provides remote voters with similar protection as that o ered by physical voting booths, essen- tially protecting them from over-the-shoulder coercion attacks (shoulder- sur ng). We introduce a framework to model voting booths and formu- late a property of the modeled booths that is sucient to ensure over- the-shoulder coercion resistance. Next, we propose an example of mental booth that is simple enough to be used by any voter without prior train- ing and show that an execution of the remote booth in the presence of the adversary is equivalent to that execution in his absence (e.g., inside a physical booth). The only cost lies in the use of an untappable chan- nel in order to transmit a piece of information before the voting phase. Mental booths also allow for the voter to safely delegate his own voice to an untrusted person while still being able to verify that the untrusted person followed his instructions while voting.},

For this purpose we have implemented the RSA algorithm in Java and our aspects with AspectJ. As a result, we show how AOP can help tremendously to enhance cryptographic protocols against SCA with nearly no negative side-effects. Moreover, we illustrate a new countermeasure against timing attacks aiming for the simple modular exponentiation technique. Our simulation performs a timing attack against the hamming weight of the secret key in a RSA cryptosystem. The success rate of the attack drops from 80$\backslash${\%} to 0$\backslash${\%} with our countermeasure.},
