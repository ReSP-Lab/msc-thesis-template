General introduction to the topic and your thesis. Make sure that this
chapter is readable by someone with general computer science knowledge.
Don't introduce concepts or acronyms that you won't later need to make your
arguments. Cite~\cite{latexcompanion} your sources~\cite{Menezes2001,
Saint-Onge1987} properly!\footnote{We don't usually use footnotes much in
Computer Science but they exist~\cite{AShamirShareSecret,

\gls{energyconsump} is the power consumption and is defined w.r.t.\ the energy consumption \gls{energyproduction} over a time $\Delta t$ \eqref{eq:eq1}.
\begin{align}
	\gls{energyconsump} = \frac{\gls{energyproduction}}{\Delta t} \equnit{\si[per-mode=symbol]{\joule\per\second}}\label{eq:eq1}
\end{align}

\section{Motivation}

\subsection{Context}

\subsection{Problem Statement \& Research Questions}

This thesis aims at securely measuring the power consumption for detecting
whether bananas are curved and elongated, and indeed resemble a crescent. I
will answer the following research questions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item[\textbf{RQ1}]{Do bananas resemble a crescent?}
  \item[\textbf{RQ2}]{How many bananas must I eat to securely identify all
    crescent-shaped bananas.}
    \todo{Motivate this research. Why would the jury care about your banana
consumption?}
\end{itemize}

To answer these questions I set out to test the following hypotheses:

\begin{itemize}
  \item[\textbf{H1}]{99.5\,\% of bananas are crescent-shaped.}
  \item[\textbf{H2}]{Crescent-shaped are sweeter than non-crescent-shaped
    bananas.}
  \item[\textbf{H3}]{Established mechanisms to improve systems' security
    are not suited to secure bananas.}
    \todo{Revise this hypothesis to make it testable.}
\end{itemize}


\section{Project Statement \& Contributions}

Be clear on what it does provide, does not provide, what is implemented,
and what is novel. In my work about bananas I didn't get very far as I
failed to enumerate or approximate 99.5\,\% of bananas.
