\chapter{Implementation \& Testing}
% Test driven design
% Design the test first, specify the kpis, the expected behaviours, the use cases, etc. See unit testing methodologies
% Then implement and continously test versus those specifications until implementation is finished
\pagestyle{fancy}
\section{Methodology} % How to conduct the experiment
% How do you test? How do you decide if it was a success? What should you conclude if result is x or y? This needs to be defined before experimenting to be sound and maybe revised after (so conclusion could be that the methodology was flawed)
\subsection{Testing methodology}
\subsection{Design methodology}
\subsection{Implementation methodology}
\section{Setup, Requirements, Environment, Tools \& Materials} % How to reproduce the experiment
\section{Results} %Raw data before analysis
